# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- It felt challenging hahaha. it felt both uncomfortable and good looking at sources i didnt fully know how to read. I didnt know ruby doesnt have method overloading. So finding the solution around that was interesting
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- Workflow is going well. feeling a little stressed. I feel like im juggling multiple things at once with the evals, scheduling pairing, group work, and studying the material on my own
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
- definitely disciplined structured breaks
